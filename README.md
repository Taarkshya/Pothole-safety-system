# Pothole safety system
Pothole safety system is an active safety system that warns the driver ( car/ bike/ any other type of vehicle) about the dangers he is going to face in the next road sections, based on his GPS position by maps or indication by other vehicles which have already visited the route , so that he can decide to change the route else go slow with care.
Aging roads and poor-road maintenance results in large number of Potholes which can Jeopardise road safety to the public, which creates Traffic Congestion and serious harm to driverâ€™s safety decreasing the transportation efficiency. To Prevent this we can detect potholes without false-positives, and perform it with higher accuracy using machine learning, deep learning and computer vision. Therefore, the proposed real-time pothole detection approach can be used to improve the safety of traffic condition. We have established connectivity between Public Vehicles and our device which rectifies the range of defect precisely as it will use the mobility of the particular vehicle on which the system will be fitted, and side by side gather data from the vibrations and the GPS sensors, now using image processing techniques the process and filtering of the data will be carried forward, and then information will be shared with the pothole repair corporation.
